- [ ] Set up Git environment and GitHub account  
- [ ] Clone repositories, create branches, commit, push changes  
- [ ] Create a Pull Request (PR) and perform a code review  
- [ ] Learn basic Git workflows (branching, merging, rebasing)  
- [ ] Write simple bash scripts to automate git commands and file operations *(if unfamiliar)*  
- [ ] Learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) basics in Python or C++ *(if unfamiliar)*

### Week 2: Docker Basics + ROS2 Fundamentals  
- [ ] Understand Docker concepts: images, containers, Dockerfile  
- [ ] Build and run a simple Docker container  
- [ ] Learn to run ROS2 nodes and understand topics, messages, and services  
- [ ] Explore ROS2 package structure and tools (colcon, ros2 CLI)  

**Resources:**  
- [Docker Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

---

### Week 3-4: ROS2 Codebase Exploration + Docker Integration  
- [ ] Read and understand ROS2 nodes in the project codebase  
- [ ] Write a simple ROS2 publisher or subscriber node  
- [ ] Debug ROS2 nodes inside and outside Docker containers  
- [ ] Integrate ROS2 nodes with Docker workflows (build, run, debug)  

**Resources:**  
- [ROS2 Publisher-Subscriber Tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Writing-A-Simple-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html)  
- [Debugging ROS2 nodes](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Debugging/)

### Week 5-6: Mini Project - ROS2 Node with Git & Docker  
**Project Title:** Simple ROS2 Sensor Simulator Node in Docker

#### Project Description:  
Create a ROS2 node that simulates a basic sensor by publishing dummy sensor data (e.g., distance or velocity) at a fixed rate. Containerize this node using Docker, push your code to a GitHub repository, and submit a Pull Request.

#### Requirements:  
- Implement a ROS2 publisher node that publishes a custom or standard message type  
- Write a Dockerfile to containerize the ROS2 node  
- Use git branches and pull requests for version control  
- Include a bash script to build and run your Docker container easily  
- Provide a README with build & run instructions and brief explanation of your code  

#### Deliverables:  
- GitHub repo/branch with your code and Dockerfile  
- A working Docker container that runs the ROS2 node publishing simulated sensor data  
- A pull request on the main project repo with a summary of your work  
- A short demo video or live demo in a team meeting  
- README.md documenting setup, usage, and overview  

---

## Optional Additional Learning  
- Basic concepts of YOLO and RANSAC-PnP algorithms *(for later onboarding)*  
- CarMaker simulation basics (for simulation-focused members)  

---

## Support and Check-ins  
You will have bi-weekly check-ins with your mentor/team lead to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
